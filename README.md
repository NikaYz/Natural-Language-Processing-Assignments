# AIM-829 Natural Language Processing - Assignment 2

This repository contains the assignments for the AIM-829 Natural Language Processing course.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment consists of :

1. **Part-of-Speech Tagging Using Hidden Markov Model**  
   In this task, we implement a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging system using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The project involves:
   - Loading and preprocessing the dataset containing sentences with word-tag pairs.
   - Computing emission and transition probabilities from the training data.
   - Using the Viterbi algorithm to determine the most likely sequence of POS tags for a given sentence.

2. **MLP from Scratch for XOR Logic Gate and MLP for Sentiment Analysis**  
   This part comprises two sub-tasks:
   - **MLP from Scratch for XOR Logic Gate:**  
     A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is implemented from scratch in Python, without relying on external deep learning libraries. The model is trained to solve the XOR logic gate problem, demonstrating the fundamentals of neural network training including forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.
   - **MLP for Sentiment Analysis:**  
     An MLP is built using libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras) to perform sentiment analysis on a text dataset with 279 distinct sentiment classes. This task involves:
     - Preprocessing and vectorizing text data.
     - Building a neural network model with an embedding layer, dense layers, and a softmax output layer.
     - Training the model using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
